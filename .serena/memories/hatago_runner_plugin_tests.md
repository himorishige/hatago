# Runner Plugin Tests Status

## Created Test Files

1. `src/runner/manifest.test.ts` - Manifest validation and command building tests
2. `src/runner/sandbox.test.ts` - Process sandboxing tests
3. `src/runner/manager.test.ts` - Runner manager tests

## Test Coverage

- Manifest validation: Required/optional fields, permissions, transport types
- Command building: All package managers (npx, pnpm, yarn, bun, deno)
- Process sandboxing: Start/stop/restart, output handling, auto-restart
- Manager operations: Registration, lifecycle, MCP client management
- Security features: Permission validation, resource limits

## Test Results

- Total tests passing: 173/182 (95%)
- Runner plugin tests: 14 manifest tests all passing
- Sandbox and manager tests: Mock-based due to child_process dependency

## Next Steps

- Integration tests for actual process spawning
- E2E tests with real MCP servers
- Performance benchmarks for process management
